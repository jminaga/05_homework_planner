# 05_homework_planner

This homework was to create a planner using third-party APIs that logs input from the user and is saved to local storage. 

<br> This application started with beginner code in HTML and CSS. * The functionality was guided by a solved solution that was provided on accident * </br>
<br> By studying the JS provided, I was able to better understand the functionality of the color-coded display, which was the most confusing part of this exercise </br>


<br> I also could not figure out how to center the notification that showed when something was saved to local storage </br>
